            <br> Introduction to Scion Coalition Scheme
            <br> The Scion Coalition Scheme is an intensive, 
            <br> specially tailored training program run by Netmatters 
            <br> in order to give willing candidates the opportunity 
            <br> to enter the industry as web developers. 
            <br> Under the supervision of senior web developers, 
            <br> scions generally aim to complete training within six 
            <br> to nine months. The course is intensive and therefore 
            <br> the level of learning achieved is extensive in a short 
            <br> space of time.
